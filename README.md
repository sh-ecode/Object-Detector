## 🏗️ Project Setup & Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Visionary-Tracker.git
cd Visionary-Tracker
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download Pretrained Model
Download the YOLOv8 model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8) and place it in the `models/` directory.

---

## 🚀 Execution Instructions
### Run Object Detection on Live Camera
```bash
python detect.py --source 0 --weights models/yolov8.pt --conf 0.5
```
### Run Object Detection on Video File
```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/video.mp4 --weights models/yolov8.pt --conf 0.5
```

### Web Interface (Optional)
If using Flask for web-based implementation, start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then, open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web UI.

---

## 🛠️ Customization
- Change the confidence threshold (`--conf 0.5`) to adjust detection sensitivity.
- Modify the `detect.py` script to fine-tune model performance.
- Replace YOLOv8 with another model (e.g., Faster R-CNN) for comparison.
